# notify_on_cmd_finish never

#: Show a desktop notification when a long-running command finishes
#: (needs shell_integration). The possible values are:

#: never
#:     Never send a notification.

#: unfocused
#:     Only send a notification when the window does not have keyboard focus.

#: invisible
#:     Only send a notification when the window both is unfocused and not visible
#:     to the user, for example, because it is in an inactive tab or its OS window
#:     is not currently active.

#: always
#:     Always send a notification, regardless of window state.

#: There are two optional arguments:

#: First, the minimum duration for what is considered a long running
#: command. The default is 5 seconds. Specify a second argument to set
#: the duration. For example: invisible 15. Do not set the value too
#: small, otherwise a command that launches a new OS Window and exits
#: will spam a notification.

#: Second, the action to perform. The default is notify. The possible
#: values are:

#: notify
#:     Send a desktop notification.

#: bell
#:     Ring the terminal bell.

#: command
#:     Run a custom command. All subsequent arguments are the cmdline to run.

#: Some more examples::

#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 5 seconds in an unfocused window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish unfocused
#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window

#:     # Here %c is replaced by the current command line and %s by the job exit code
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 command notify-send "job finished with status: %s" %c

# term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow"
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

# terminfo_type path

#: The value of the TERMINFO environment variable to set. This
#: variable is used by programs running in the terminal to search for
#: terminfo databases. The default value of path causes kitty to set
#: it to a filesystem location containing the kitty terminfo database.
#: A value of direct means put the entire database into the env var
#: directly. This can be useful when connecting to containers, for
#: example. But, note that not all software supports this. A value of
#: none means do not touch the variable.

# forward_stdio no

#: Forward STDOUT and STDERR of the kitty process to child processes
#: as file descriptors 3 and 4. This is useful for debugging as it
#: allows child processes to print to kitty's STDOUT directly. For
#: example, echo hello world >&3 in a shell will print to the parent
#: kitty's STDOUT. When enabled, this also sets the
#: KITTY_STDIO_FORWARDED=3 environment variable so child processes
#: know about the forwarding.

# menu_map

#: Specify entries for various menus in kitty. Currently only the
#: global menubar on macOS is supported. For example::

#:    menu_map global "Actions::Launch something special" launch --hold --type=os-window sh -c "echo hello world"

#: This will create a menu entry named "Launch something special" in
#: an "Actions" menu in the macOS global menubar. Sub-menus can be
#: created by adding more levels separated by the :: characters.

#: OS specific tweaks {{{

# wayland_titlebar_color system

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on Wayland systems with
#: client side window decorations such as GNOME. A value of system
#: means to use the default system colors, a value of background means
#: to use the background color of the currently active kitty window
#: and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red.

# macos_titlebar_color system

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value of
#: system means to use the default system color, light or dark can
#: also be used to set it explicitly. A value of background means to
#: use the background color of the currently active window and finally
#: you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red. WARNING:
#: This option works by using a hack when arbitrary color (or
#: background) is configured, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it.
#: It sets the background color of the entire window and makes the
#: titlebar transparent. As such it is incompatible with
#: background_opacity. If you want to use both, you are probably
#: better off just hiding the titlebar with hide_window_decorations.

# macos_option_as_alt no

#: Use the Option key as an Alt key on macOS. With this set to no,
#: kitty will use the macOS native Option+Key to enter Unicode
#: character behavior. This will break any Alt+Key keyboard shortcuts
#: in your terminal programs, but you can use the macOS Unicode input
#: technique. You can use the values: left, right or both to use only
#: the left, right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Note that
#: kitty itself always treats Option the same as Alt. This means you
#: cannot use this option to configure different kitty shortcuts for
#: Option+Key vs. Alt+Key. Also, any kitty shortcuts using
#: Option/Alt+Key will take priority, so that any such key presses
#: will not be passed to terminal programs running inside kitty.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: Hide the kitty window from running tasks on macOS (âŒ˜+Tab and the
#: Dock). Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed on macOS.
#: By default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as
#: is the expected behavior on macOS.

# macos_window_resizable yes

#: Disable this if you want kitty top-level OS windows to not be
#: resizable on macOS.

# macos_thicken_font 0

#: Draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes on macOS. For example, a
#: value of 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-
#: pixel antialiasing at common font sizes. Note that in modern kitty,
#: this option is obsolete (although still supported). Consider using
#: text_composition_strategy instead.

# macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: Use the macOS traditional full-screen transition, that is faster,
#: but less pretty.

# macos_show_window_title_in all

#: Control where the window title is displayed on macOS. A value of
#: window will show the title of the currently active window at the
#: top of the macOS window. A value of menubar will show the title of
#: the currently active window in the macOS global menu bar, making
#: use of otherwise wasted space. A value of all will show the title
#: in both places, and none hides the title. See
#: macos_menubar_title_max_length for how to control the length of the
#: title in the menu bar.

# macos_menubar_title_max_length 0

#: The maximum number of characters from the window title to show in
#: the macOS global menu bar. Values less than one means that there is
#: no maximum limit.

# macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Use a custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see on both
#: light and dark backgrounds. Nowadays, the default macOS cursor
#: already comes with a white border. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines. Changing this option
#: by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_colorspace srgb

#: The colorspace in which to interpret terminal colors. The default
#: of srgb will cause colors to match those seen in web browsers. The
#: value of default will use whatever the native colorspace of the
#: display is. The value of displayp3 will use Apple's special
#: snowflake display P3 color space, which will result in over
#: saturated (brighter) colors with some color shift. Reloading
#: configuration will change this value only for newly created OS
#: windows.

# linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

# wayland_enable_ime yes

#: Enable Input Method Extension on Wayland. This is typically used
#: for inputting text in East Asian languages. However, its
#: implementation in Wayland is often buggy and introduces latency
#: into the input loop, so disable this if you know you dont need it.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported, it
#: will not have any effect.

#: }}}

#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase Unicode characters.
#: For example: a for the A key, [ for the left square bracket key,
#: etc. For functional keys, such as Enter or Escape, the names are
#: present at Functional key definitions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#functional>.
#: For modifier keys, the names are ctrl (control, âŒƒ), shift (â‡§), alt
#: (opt, option, âŒ¥), super (cmd, command, âŒ˜).

#: Simple shortcut mapping is done with the map directive. For full
#: details on advanced mapping including modal and per application
#: maps, see mapping <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/mapping/>. Some
#: quick examples to illustrate common tasks::

#:     # unmap a keyboard shortcut, passing it to the program running in kitty
#:     map kitty_mod+space
#:     # completely ignore a keyboard event
#:     map ctrl+alt+f1 discard_event
#:     # combine multiple actions
#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout
#:     # multi-key shortcuts
#:     map ctrl+x>ctrl+y>z action

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

# kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: Special modifier key alias for default shortcuts. You can change
#: the value of this option to alter all default shortcuts that use
#: kitty_mod.

# clear_all_shortcuts no

#: Remove all shortcut definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# action_alias

#: E.g. action_alias launch_tab launch --type=tab --cwd=current

#: Define action aliases to avoid repeating the same options in
#: multiple mappings. Aliases can be defined for any action and will
#: be expanded recursively. For example, the above alias allows you to
#: create mappings to launch a new tab in the current working
#: directory without duplication::

#:     map f1 launch_tab vim
#:     map f2 launch_tab emacs

#: Similarly, to alias kitten invocation::

#:     action_alias hints kitten hints --hints-offset=0

# kitten_alias

#: E.g. kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: Like action_alias above, but specifically for kittens. Generally,
#: prefer to use action_alias. This option is a legacy version,
#: present for backwards compatibility. It causes all invocations of
#: the aliased kitten to be substituted. So the example above will
#: cause all invocations of the hints kitten to have the --hints-
#: offset=0 option applied.

#: Clipboard {{{

#: Copy to clipboard

# map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard
# map cmd+c       copy_to_clipboard

#::  There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#::  mapped to Ctrl+C. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#::  send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly,
#::  copy_and_clear_or_interrupt will copy and clear the selection or
#::  send an interrupt if there is no selection.

#: Paste from clipboard

# map kitty_mod+v paste_from_clipboard
# map cmd+v       paste_from_clipboard

#: Paste from selection

# map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
# map shift+insert paste_from_selection

#: Pass selection to program

# map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program

#::  You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#::  program with pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#::  open program is used, but you can specify your own, the selection
#::  will be passed as a command line argument to the program. For
#::  example::

#::      map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#::  You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running

# map kitty_mod+f8 swap_with_window

#::  Works like focus_visible_window above, but swaps the window.

#: Move tab backward

# map kitty_mod+, move_tab_backward

#: Set tab title

# map kitty_mod+alt+t set_tab_title
# map shift+cmd+i     set_tab_title


#: You can also create shortcuts to go to specific tabs, with 1 being
#: the first tab, 2 the second tab and -1 being the previously active
#: tab, -2 being the tab active before the previously active tab and
#: so on. Any number larger than the number of tabs goes to the last
#: tab and any number less than the number of previously used tabs in
#: the history goes to the oldest previously used tab in the history::

#:     map ctrl+alt+1 goto_tab 1
#:     map ctrl+alt+2 goto_tab 2

#: Just as with new_window above, you can also pass the name of
#: arbitrary commands to run when using new_tab and new_tab_with_cwd.
#: Finally, if you want the new tab to open next to the current tab
#: rather than at the end of the tabs list, use::

#:     map ctrl+t new_tab !neighbor [optional cmd to run]

#: Layout management {{{

#: Next layout

# map kitty_mod+l next_layout


#: You can also create shortcuts to switch to specific layouts::

#:     map ctrl+alt+t goto_layout tall
#:     map ctrl+alt+s goto_layout stack

#: Similarly, to switch back to the previous layout::

#:     map ctrl+alt+p last_used_layout

#: There is also a toggle_layout action that switches to the named
#: layout or back to the previous layout if in the named layout.
#: Useful to temporarily "zoom" the active window by switching to the
#: stack layout::

#:     map ctrl+alt+z toggle_layout stack

#: Reset the terminal

# map kitty_mod+delete clear_terminal reset active
# map opt+cmd+r        clear_terminal reset active

#::  You can create shortcuts to clear/reset the terminal. For
#::  example::

#::      # Reset the terminal
#::      map f1 clear_terminal reset active
#::      # Clear the terminal screen by erasing all contents
#::      map f1 clear_terminal clear active
#::      # Clear the terminal scrollback by erasing it
#::      map f1 clear_terminal scrollback active
#::      # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
#::      map f1 clear_terminal scroll active
#::      # Clear everything on screen up to the line with the cursor or the start of the current prompt (needs shell integration)
#::      map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor active
#::      # Same as above except cleared lines are moved into scrollback
#::      map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor_scroll active

#::  If you want to operate on all kitty windows instead of just the
#::  current one, use all instead of active.

#::  Some useful functions that can be defined in the shell rc files
#::  to perform various kinds of clearing of the current window:

#::  .. code-block:: sh

#::      clear-only-screen() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[2J"
#::      }

#::      clear-screen-and-scrollback() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[3J"
#::      }

#::      clear-screen-saving-contents-in-scrollback() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[22J"
#::      }

#::  For instance, using these escape codes, it is possible to remap
#::  Ctrl+L to both scroll the current screen contents into the
#::  scrollback buffer and clear the screen, instead of just clearing
#::  the screen. For ZSH, in ~/.zshrc, add:

#::  .. code-block:: zsh

#::      ctrl_l() {
#::          builtin print -rn -- $'\r\e[0J\e[H\e[22J' >"$TTY"
#::          builtin zle .reset-prompt
#::          builtin zle -R
#::      }
#::      zle -N ctrl_l
#::      bindkey '^l' ctrl_l

#::  Alternatively, you can just add map ctrl+l clear_terminal
#::  to_cursor_scroll active to kitty.conf which works with no changes
#::  to the shell rc files, but only clears up to the prompt, it does
#::  not clear anytext at the prompt itself.

#: Clear up to cursor line

# map cmd+k clear_terminal to_cursor active

#: Reload kitty.conf

# map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file
# map ctrl+cmd+,   load_config_file

#::  Reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it
#::  was loaded. Note that a handful of options cannot be dynamically
#::  changed and require a full restart of kitty. Particularly, when
#::  changing shortcuts for actions located on the macOS global menu
#::  bar, a full restart is needed. You can also map a keybinding to
#::  load a different config file, for example::

#::      map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#::  Note that all options from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#::  in other words the new configuration *replace* the old ones.

#: Debug kitty configuration

# map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config
# map opt+cmd+,    debug_config

#::  Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running
#::  with and its host environment. Useful for debugging issues.

#: Send arbitrary text on key presses

#::  E.g. map ctrl+shift+alt+h send_text all Hello World

#::  You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#::  client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For
#::  example::

#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#::  This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+A key
#::  combination. The text to be sent decodes ANSI C escapes
#::  <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/ANSI_002dC-
#::  Quoting.html> so you can use escapes like \e to send control
#::  codes or \u21fb to send Unicode characters (or you can just input
#::  the Unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). You can use
#::  `kitten show-key` to get the key escape codes you want to
#::  emulate.

#::  The first argument to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to
#::  activate the shortcut. The possible values are normal,
#::  application, kitty or a comma separated combination of them. The
#::  modes normal and application refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode
#::  for terminals, and kitty refers to the kitty extended keyboard
#::  protocol. The special value all means all of them.

#::  Some more examples::

#::      # Output a word and move the cursor to the start of the line (like typing and pressing Home)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\e[H
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\eOH
#::      # Run a command at a shell prompt (like typing the command and pressing Enter)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal,application some command with arguments\r
