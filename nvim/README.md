# Neovim Configurations

These are my neovim configurations. I keep several for either different purposes, or as an archive.
My main (and current) configuration is always named `nvim`. Here is a brief explanation of each.

1. nvim

Own configuration, called [LEOVIM](https://github.com/leogabac/leovim) and stored in its own repo. Designed to work with Python, LaTeX and Markdown as they are the typical tools I use at the moment.

2. nvim-lazyvim

Previous configuration based on [LazyVim](http://www.lazyvim.org/).
